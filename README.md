**THE STEPS** 

01 - Getting the Data

02 - Basic Preprocessing and understanding data

03 - Preprocessing (encoding, feature extraction, dealing will nulls)

04 - Exploratory Data Analysis (understanding how metrics affect the number of points and how they are related)

05 - Feature Selection (Understanding relation with target variable and with each other with Multicolinearity matrix)

06 - Modelling (Comparing various models with evaluation metrics)

07 - Hyperparameter tuning

08 - Summary and Conclusions
